# Classification-of-Capsule-Endoscopy-Images
<p>Capsule endoscopy is a minimally invasive procedure that allows 
physicians to examine the gastrointestinal (GI) tract by swallowing a 
small capsule with a camera inside. The camera captures images of the GI 
tract as the capsule travels through the digestive system, providing 
detailed information about the condition of the intestinal lining. The 
images captured by the capsule are critical in diagnosing and monitoring 
GI diseases such as Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and small bowel 
tumors.</p>
<p>Image classification is a challenging task due to the complexity and 
variability of the images captured by the capsule camera. The 
classification of capsule endoscopy images can be time-consuming and 
subject to interpretation, depending on the level of expertise of the 
physician reviewing the images. The development of automated 
diagnostic tools to classify these images can significantly enhance the 
efficiency and accuracy of diagnosis.</p>
<p>In recent years, deep learning methods, especially Convolutional Neural 
Networks (CNN), have demonstrated remarkable success in image 
classification tasks. The availability of large-scale medical image datasets 
has enabled the development of deep learning models for a variety of 
medical imaging applications. The Kwasir Capsule dataset, containing 
8,000 images of the gastrointestinal tract, including normal and abnormal 
findings, is one such example.</p>

<p>This project aims to classify capsule endoscopy images using CNNs and 
the Kwasir Capsule dataset. The project's primary objective is to develop 
an accurate and efficient deep learning model for classifying capsule 
endoscopy images, with the potential to support medical professionals in 
the diagnosis of GI diseases.</p>
<p>The project involves several stages, including data preprocessing, 
model development, training, and evaluation. The Kwasir Capsule dataset 
has been preprocessed and split into training, validation, and testing sets. A 
CNN model has been designed and trained on the training set using the 
Keras deep learning framework. The model has be optimized using the 
Adam optimizer and evaluated using accuracy and other performance 
metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score.</p>
<p>The project also includes a visualization of the CNN model's 
activations, allowing for a better understanding of the model's decision making process. The model's ability to distinguish between normal and 
abnormal images will be particularly useful in identifying potential 
gastrointestinal diseases or abnormalities, allowing for earlier 
intervention and treatment.</p>
